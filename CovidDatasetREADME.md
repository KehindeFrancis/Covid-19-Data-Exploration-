This is one of my projects about COVID-19.

I extracted data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths (Dataset Files are in repository). This dataset was last updated September 9, 2022.

I broke the data up into two different tables, taking columns related to deaths and putting them in one table, then taking columns related to vaccines and putting them in a different table.

I ran a few different queries, breaking the data down into different categories using SQL (SQL_Query File is in repository):

DeathPercentage for each country;
PercentOfPopulationInfected by country per day;
Highest Infection Rates per country;
Countries with Highest Death Count;
Total Death count for per Continent 
World Death DeathPercentage;
CTE Table and TEMP Table;
List of created views;
I then imported the data into Tableau Public to create a few visualizations. 

The results of the numbered queries are in the results folder
